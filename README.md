# Moonstrap
Moonstrap is a bootstrapper for building the PaleMoon web browser on FreeBSD

The script is optimised for use in a FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE jail built by iocage.
Please see http://iocage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for more information.

Eventually, jail creation will be automated as part of Moonstrap as well.
