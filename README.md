# Moonstrap
Moonstrap is a bootstrapper for building the PaleMoon web browser.
The script is optimised for use in a FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE jail built by iocage.
However, 0.6 brings with it Linux support!

Jail creation is automated with MoonstrapJ
MoonstrapJ only works with FreeBSD.

Problems currently prevent Pale Moon from building within FreeBSD.

However, Moonstrap handles the needful to prepare the build environment, on TWO WHOLE OSES! :D
Moonstrap does the needfuls!
Not only that, the official Linux build distro (CentOS 6) 
has full, WORKING support! WHOOOOO! \o/ \o\ /o/ \o/
