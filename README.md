# Moonstrap
Moonstrap is a bootstrapper for building the PaleMoon web browser on FreeBSD

http://www.palemoon.org/
https://www.freebsd.org/

The script is optimised for use in a FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE jail built by iocage.
Please see http://iocage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for more information.

Jail creation is automated with MoonstrapJ

Problems currently prevent Pale Moon from building within FreeBSD.

However, Moonstrap handles the needful to prepare the build environment.
Once the hurdle in Pale Moon itself is overcome, Moonstrap will be here to do the needfuls.
